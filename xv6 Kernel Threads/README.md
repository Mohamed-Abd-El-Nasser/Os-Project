  ## Project requirements
  
**A.** Implement the clone() system call to create a kernel thread.

**B.** Implement the join() system call to wait for a thread to exit then kill it.

**C.** Implement a simple turn lock to support multi-threading.  

**D.** Build a little thread library to be on top of the raw system calls, with a create_thread(), join_thread(), init_lock(), acquire_lock(), and release_lock() functions to provide abstraction.

  ## C. Building a simple turn lock to support multi-threaded programs.

  ## D. Building a little thread library to be on top of the raw system calls.
